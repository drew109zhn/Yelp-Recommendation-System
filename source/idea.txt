Yelp recommender system for users with reviews

Given a user id, (maybe) a threshold rating:

1. From the user's reviews, get the set of cities (Cities) & set of categories (Categories) the businesses the user reviewed are in

2. Create a set of potential recommendations (Potentials) from Cities and Categories, i.e. businesses in Cities that has at least a category in Categories 

3. From the user's reviews, train a model of user's preference:
- Attributes: set of business.categories and business.attributes 
- Target variable: whether the user likes the business or not (using the threshold rating, default=4) - LIKE or DISLIKE
- Problem: is this dataset too small? Average review_count is only about 24.

4. Run model (or classifier) on Potentials, return LIKE ones
