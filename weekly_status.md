# Weekly Status Reports

Each week, please spend 5-10 minutes writing a brief status report.  This does not need to be highly detailed. Some examples are provided below that give some indication of the level of detail.

*Copy the template below for each subsequent week.  Please put the most recent week at the **TOP** of the page.*


## Week 1

Report for the week of 3/20/17 to 3/27/17.

We worked on choosing a good project for this week, but on Tuesday 03/28/2017 we had to change because our data is not big enough
Therefore, this week does not count any more.

*[Brief description]:

## Week 2

#Report for the week of 03/08/2017 to /04/03/2017.
* Duy: This week I worked on creating a psql directory from the Yelp dataset that we downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/
* Ha: This week I worked on doing some data retrieving from the database that Duy created. In particular, the two worthwhile things that I collected are:
1, Files of the 1000 most funny/cool/useful (most funny/cool/useful votes) reviews. We were trying to answer a question suggested by the competition
description: "What makes a review funny/cool/useful?". We plan to do some text mining stuff with it.
2, Files of the accumulative data about the checked-in times of the weeks for the 10 cities with the most check-ins. I will draw histogram plots for each of these
10 cities to see-- for each city-- the most popular times.

#Work distribution:
* Duy: 50 %
* Ha: 50 %

* Our main goal for this week is to explore some interesting questions that we can answer from the data, and prepare the data to answer such questions.
